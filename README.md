# jenkins4casc

Repository for the Praqma custom Docker image using the new [Configuration as Code plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin).

## How to use the Docker image

Basically the same way as you would use the official Jenkins Docker image. With one difference. If you start a container using this image with an environment variable `CASC_JENKINS_CONFIG` you can configure Jenkins to be configured on startup. And if you point to a configuration file from an URL you can reconfigure without the need for a restart.

### Example: Minimum Configuration

`
chmod -R 777 jenkins-mini.yaml
mkdir /opt/jenkins_home
chmod -R 777 /opt/jenkins_home
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v /opt/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home -v jenkins-mini.yaml:/var/jenkins.yaml -e CASC_JENKINS_CONFIG=/var/jenkins.yaml jenkins4casc`

We added the switch

`-e CASC_JENKINS_CONFIG=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Praqma/jenkins4casc/master/jenkins-minimal-example.yaml`

To point to the smallest possible configuration of Jenkins with Jenkins configuration as code:

```
jenkins:
  systemMessage: "The smallest possible configuration for Jenkins Configuration as Code plugin"
```

This gives this message on the welcome screen when Jenkins boots up:

For more advanced examples take a look at the demos sections found in the [official repository for Configuration as Code plugin repository](https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin)

### Example using Docker Compose and Docker secrets

We have a running example using Docker compose you're free to take a look at located [here](https://github.com/Praqma/praqma-jenkins-casc).

## Docker image versioning strategy

The tag `latest` always refer to an image build from `HEAD` on master. When we do an official release we create a tag corresponding to the version of the included plugin. For instance, at the time of this writing the latest version of the plugin is `0.2-alpha` when the Docker image for this version is ready we'll release a version with the tag `praqma/jenkins4casc:0.2-alpha` and `praqma/jenkins4casc:0.2-alpha-latest`.

If we need to update the Docker image, with a change that is not related to a new version of the plugin we'll create a new version with the tag `0.2-alpha-1`and update the tag `praqma/jenkins4casc:0.2-alpha-latest`.

### Docker autobuild

To create a new docker image on Docker hub, simply tag your commit with a version tag as described above, try to match the version with the version of the included Configuration As Code plugin. So for instance if you create a tag: `0.7-alpha` and push your change to github, you'll get a docker image with the label: `jenkins4casc:0.7-alpha` which is what you want.

The repository is setup with Docker autobuild enabled. We build all tags, and master is always built and made available as `latest`. Versioning is based on the convention described in the Docker image versioning strategy section above.

For more information about how Docker Hub autobuild works please consult the [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/).
